                    A toy called a flip book4 was made in the late 19th century. It was a small soft book with pictures. Each picture was drawn in a slightly different5 way. When you bend this book and release the pages one by one, the images start to move. Strictly speaking, they don’t, but our eyes see it like that anyway. The first real cartoons were made using this trick, too! In 1895 brothers Louis and Auguste Lumière created a cinematograph. It was a camera and a film projector in one device. Using this device, many aspiring6 film directors started to create their own cartoons.
